To run program download or clone all files. Because the app uses AJAX to load templates, you cannot open index.html from the file:// protocol. Instead, you must start a web server to load your app. On a Mac, you can run $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer from your project directly, and then in your browser, visit http://0.0.0.0:8000 or localhost:8000.
